      books and authors.
        - ./booklist.pl
    - Find all books in your knowledge base written by one author.
```
| ?- ['booklist.pl'].
| ?- wrote(demitry, What).      

What = metro_2033 ? ;

What = metro_2034 ? ;

What = metro_2035

yes
```
    - Make a knowledge base representing musicians and instruments.
      Also represent musicians and their genre of music.
        - ./music.pl
    - Find all musicians who play the guitar.
```
| ?- ['musicians.pl'].
| ?- plays(Who, guitar).

Who = hannes_wadar ? ;
